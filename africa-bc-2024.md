blockchain cryptocurrency decentralized
finance central bank digital currencies
and the future of money
so i'm going to be talking about in this
course blockchain decentralized finance
and nfts central bank digital currencies
and cryptocurrency and um the different
cryptocurrencies
um so just a bit of a disclaimer here
a lot of this content
works at the intersection between
computer science cryptography finance
and economics
um i'm not a computer scientist
and i'm not a cryptographer
but i am an expert in finance and
economics
so i might be a bit light on the
computer science parts and the
cryptography parts um but i can talk a
lot to the finance and economics of
these technologies um so computer
scientists please
if you see anything that isn't quite
accurate or you see anything that you'd
like to sort of um me to edit in this
video i'm more than happy to do it i'm
not claiming to be an expert in crypto
cryptography or um
or computer science but um i think you
have my insurances that the finance and
the economics parts would be right but
obviously a lot of these topics um sit
in a complex intersection between these
four disciplines
what this course is not
it's not a course on how to day trade
crypto so all of those people to tell
you that uh get into crypto that you'll
be a billionaire in one week if you want
to be the next alico dangote then just
start trading crypto and you can get
there in one month this is not one of
those courses
um number two it's not a how to make
money from crypto costs so i'm not going
to teach you you know that i see all
kinds of weird tutorials on you know i'm
going to teach you how to be a
billionaire from crypto i'm going to
teach you how to buy your first house
from crypto it's not that kind of
lecture either um it's an academic
lecture and definitely if you're the
type of person that is thinking um after
listening to this lecture by next week
you'll be posting the car or the
lamborghini that you bought
um from crypto on instagram um if your
aim is to really um you know floss for
your friends on instagram and show them
your new car this probably isn't the
lecture for you they're people that
specialize um in that area and i'm not
one of them in fact i'm neither a
bitcoin maximalist or minimalist so i'm
not you know you see some people on the
internet treat it almost like it's a
religion i'm i'm definitely not a
maximalist but i don't believe it's
nothing i don't believe it's a fluke
either i'm kind of in the middle i feel
a bit quite neutral about um the future
of bitcoin it might be the future of
money it might be you know the biggest
revolution to the finance industry that
we know it might be a kind of slow burn
thing that people eventually get over
who knows
like i said even doctor strange could
not tell the future but what i'm going
to be talking about is what's happening
now
and what may happen in the future
so what is
blockchain blockchain is a chain of
blocks
that documents information designed to
originally
like i said timestamp documents so that
they can't be changed
and it wasn't until 2009 when it was
used to create a digital currency
so
the way i see it is that blockchain
is a technology
just like powerpoint and i'm using i
used powerpoint to put together this
presentation
but
blockchain is a technology
and i've chosen to use powerpoint to
give this presentation
but you can use powerpoint for a lot of
other things as well there's a lady
called nancy duarte that teaches on
presentations and she wrote an entire
book using powerpoint
so she actually used
powerpoint technology to actually write
her book
and then there's a lot of people that do
these instagram posts with motivational
quotes
um especially the people that specialize
in i don't know if you see them on
twitter they're mostly on instagram
where they you know write the scars
maybe who i am and again they use
powerpoint to make those with their
motivation on flyers um so they use
powerpoint to design the flyer then they
convert it to jpeg and then they post it
on instagram hard work will get you
anywhere
so what i'm saying is on the underlying
technology can actually help you do a
lot of things and the same as blockchain
blockchain technology can be used to
make smart contracts um it can also be
the underlying technology
that you use for digital currency and
that's what satoshi nakamoto used it for
but the difference between powerpoint
and blockchain technology is that
even if i made a powerpoint presentation
10 years ago
and
you know i don't like it anymore i can
go back into the powerpoint and i can
change whatever is on the powerpoint i
can change it totally i can change it
everything about it and rehash the whole
presentation to make it a different
presentation
and
if i hadn't sent it to anybody
nobody would really know
the blockchain is different so
once it's on the blockchain
is on the blockchain forever it cannot
be changed you cannot change the time
you cannot change the data
very very difficult and i'll be
explaining why
so like i said
blockchain is a chain of blocks that
contains information
that is was originally designed to
timestamp information and i'll be
talking more about blockchains as we go
on through this presentation but right
now
just view them as uh digital blocks that
contain information which is extremely
difficult to change
particularly the time stamp the time
that is done is the time and when we
talk about when i first posted back in
2017 on twitter about blockchain
elections i think the reason why it
generated so much excitement is because
it cannot be changed and i know that
well maybe america i don't know but
anyway the uk and europe um you know it
might be a less it might be a less
natural thing to think about why would
you change an election result in the
first place
in africa or
like i told you that
there's a use case for wanting to
timestamp the time
of people's votes in a way they can't be
changed and i would say more than that
um but you know there's a lot of use
cases for this technology
um so terms to understand before we dive
in
um what's a hash what's a node
what does consensus mean in the concept
in the context of cryptocurrency um
what's proof of work what's proof of
stake um so like i did in the earlier
lectures i really like to define things
before we go into the body of the
lecture
because that helps everybody get
familiar with the term so when i'm using
them and i'm using them very very
quickly in conversations
it's easy for people to catch on so the
first definition is a hash what's a hash
a hash is like a fingerprint
an immutable
that means undeletable cryptographic
signature
and these are recorded on the blockchain
so it's the the cryptographic signature
with that
with which transactions are recorded on
on the blockchain
what's a node
a node is a computer connected to other
computers which follows rules and shares
information
so i could be a node you could be a node
anybody could be a node
but what a node means is it's connected
to the bitcoin uh it is connected to the
network bitcoins network and it means
that when a transaction is done
then everybody gets a copy of that
transaction
and that is it that's why it can't be
changed
even if you want to fly around the world
there are people's computers connected
around the world
so
some may be in
delta state some may be in uganda some
may be in kenya some will be in ethiopia
some will even be in sudan so for you to
be able to change everybody the
information on all these people's
computers and i've only used african
examples but really there are hundreds
around the world in villages that you
can't even get to in terms of are very
you can't change it because
the nodes all communicate
and they all have the same information
and that's why it's difficult to change
because people notice that you've tried
to change it
consensus as it relates to blockchain so
consensus is um
the consensus algorithm is a mechanism
that uses and that allows users or
machines to coordinate in distributed
settings so that's a consensus algorithm
and this was a wonderful thing about
bitcoin that allowed all the users to
communicate in a distributed setting and
i'll be talking about um the
benzertine
generals using an african example later
but this is really i mean um you can
watch whole lectures just about this
consensus because consensus is the core
of what makes this technology work um
because it needs to ensure that all
agents
in the system can agree on a single
source of the truth
okay
byzantine general's problem so before i
go into the byzantine generals problem
i would
give an example of if this thing
happened in nigeria so let's say it was
a hundred years ago in nigeria
and um
the uba and ibu and hausa and
south-south people got together
and said you know what we're tired of
being colonized
the white people are all in lagos we're
going to attack and we're going to drive
them
out that would mean that each tribe
would have to surround lagos
so let's say the europa people came from
lagos ibadan expressway
and they now
gathered around just outside lagos just
around that um
because the the end of lagos about an
expressway just getting into um omole
area right in lagos
and then let's say the hausa people came
by ecuador
into lagos
and then let's say the south south
people
not to be stereotypical you know you
people are my people but just for the
sake of the story came through the
lagoon and they were in boats
um and let's say um who haven't i
mentioned evil people import people
decided to come through
and they were all waiting
at
midnight
remember there were no mobile phones
it's 100 years ago and they were all
waiting at midnight
to attack these people and drive them
out of our country
how do they communicate
no phone no was up
no email they have to send somebody
so that means that the europa people at
lagos ibadan expressway need to send
somebody to the people at the lagoon
because if they don't attack all at the
same time then the attack is going to
fail
that means that the house of people i
don't know where they are located now i
think they were coming from a courageous
side into lagos they also have to send a
messenger
remember that the south south people
have no idea
how
the messenger coming from the house
person will look
now
they have no idea if the messengers can
even be infiltrated
where one of those white people will say
okay let's change the messenger and give
a different message
because what will happen if one group
comes into lagos
without the support of all the other
groups that they'll definitely die
it could even get worse what if one of
the generals has already concluded or
colluded
with the colonial masters
and said
you know
for a few minutes
i can deal with these people and i'll
just give these people false information
and they'll come in and you kill them
all
this is the problem
the byzantine
generals problem
so this problem was actually conceived
in 1982
but obviously it wasn't with nigerians i
just used nigerians for an example
because i like to use nutrients for
everything but
this was actually the byzantine generals
problem and people have been working on
it since 1982
and it's the same kind of dilemma how do
a group of byzantine generals
agree on what their next move should be
when
they have to use messengers to
communicate and they don't completely
trust each other
so how can they get messages to each
other without some of the messages
getting delayed destroyed or lost
and that is the same thing
with these cryptocurrency transactions
on the blockchain
how do we do a trial because remember
when we do transactions
it's not
to me that keeps a record of those
transactions it's not a mecca that keeps
a record of the transactions the reason
why i know that a transaction has been
done is because anything is keeping a
record of that transaction and then if
that can even go funny if it wasn't can
you imagine if there was no central bank
then all the banks would go funny
it's the government the central bank
that actually makes sure like people
don't actually realize how this thing
works and um there's another video on my
youtube which is on banking supervision
and regulation
so you can see that actually
we only trust in the banks because of
the government in fact do you know how
many times the government is sending
supervisors to the bank to make sure
that the bank is not chasing anybody
so the reason why we escape that problem
is because there's a central authority
that keeps those players in line
but in the case of bitcoin we're now
saying that we don't want any central
authority that we just want to be doing
it by ourselves so who is going to keep
the record everybody has to have the
record
and that's the problem that
satoshi nakamoto
realized he had to find a solution to
when he was creating bitcoin
that those transactions have to show up
on everybody's computers
otherwise who's going to
we can't trust anybody we don't even
trust our banks without the government
backing
so there needs to be a certain there
needs to be a way that we can solve this
problem of consensus
so another definition is the generous uh
the genesis block the genesis block is
given is the name given to the first
block in a cryptocurrency so the first
bitcoin ever mined was the bitcoin
genesis block and all the other ones
have um genesis block um and because
it's called the genesis block i just put
a picture of adam and eve in the garden
of eden
um and then proof of work what's proof
of work a proof-of-work algorithm is the
algorithm that secures cryptocurrencies
and most of the top sort of i guess
maybe even five cryptocurrencies all are
secured by proof-of-work um algorithms
um so proof-of-work is
to it solves the double-spending problem
to make sure that one
unit of the currency cannot be spent
twice
and that's how you bring out the next
bitcoin so each
bitcoin that is created
is created through somebody solving a
proof of work
um a proof-of-work puzzle
so how you actually get the number of
bitcoins is growing every single day
and it's because this doesn't happen in
nigeria because we don't have the power
but because people have factories with
computers
probably like 100 or 200 computers
all working on solving one particular
proof-of-work puzzle
and the power that it takes to do that
nigeria actually does not produce that's
why we don't produce bitcoin but that is
called the proof of work
so blocks are actually made
by
the miners usually in china in russia
in places where
well i say electricity is reasonably
priced if you try nigeria you just shut
down the whole of lagos state because
you need a lot of competing power to be
able to solve these proof-of-work
puzzles
and before it gets harder and harder as
the chain develops it actually gets
harder and harder to solve these
proof-of-work puzzles so now even people
that people rent whole factories
like
dangote
size factories indominus size factories
and they have
rows of computers all solving this
because each bitcoin is now 60 000
and if you live in a country where
you know you can talk to the authorities
or you can talk to the people supplying
electricity just give them
wherever you can towards whatever they
do
you know and you can have an arrangement
between you then you can actually
produce each bitcoin
at a very very low price
um
but you know it's a very
high energy um procedure to produce each
bitcoin and the reason why is because
each one that is produced
nodes around the world have to
be able to confirm that this is the
person that solved that puzzle
and even now it's gotten to the stage
where there are networks of these
factories
that all have clubbed together and say
okay if you are the one that solves then
we split the money between us if you are
the one everybody in this network
whoever sells will split the money so
that's how they they manage their
arrangements with solving the proof of
work algorithms and bringing
out each new bitcoin
and some people say that
the amount of energy
that it takes every year to produce
that is used in producing bitcoin is
like a small european country basically
it's a huge amount of electricity
um
so
a lot some people argue that bitcoin
isn't very
environmentally friendly
because of the amount of power that it
uses
but then some people will also argue
that when you go to every bat every in
this nigeria every bank branch has a gem
and then when you think of all the
bank branches in africa when you think
of all the branches around the world
all consume power
is it not easier
to is it not less electricity
used in producing bitcoin than powering
all the banks all around the world in
the traditional banking system
so that's the argument that bitcoin
maximalists will make when they say it
uses too much electricity but there is
an alternative and it's called proof of
stake
so people stake is actually a mechanism
that uses randomly selected validators
to validate each block rather than
having to solve any puzzle
and what you have to do is if you want
to be one of the people that has a
chance of getting this block then you
have to put your own cryptocurrency
um as a stake
and if you try and cheat them you cannot
collect it back
so that's proof of stake and proof of
stake users so the difference between
proof of work and proof of stake is
proof of stake uses randomly selected
miners to validate transactions whereas
a proof of work uses a competitive
method
to
confirm transactions and add
new blocks to the blockchain
what are gas fees
obviously we're not talking about pms or
petrol gas fees
refer to the amount of ethereum
required to interact with the user in
the web in the network and when you're
buying nfts for instance you pay gas
fees
so
those gas fees are used to compensate
ethereum miners for the energy used to
verify a transaction
what's a 51 attack i'm sure everybody
has thought about it
what if one person is able to dominate
so much of the network
or so many computers in the network that
they themselves can start controlling it
so this is known as a 51 attack
um also known as a majority attack this
is when a single person or group of
people
gains control over 50 percent of the
hashing power remember i told you about
hashes each unit is a hash or each uh
yeah it's a digital fingerprint of the
data so
when you control over 50 of blockchain's
hashing power
then it's known as a 51 attack
and this is usually achieved by renting
mining
renting mining hash power from a third
party
so
people ask that question as to look this
thing is fundamentally unstable
what if
people are able to form a cartel and
if you look on youtube i have
a lecture
in my microeconomics series about cartel
formation and what you need to form a
cartel but i believe that this is a kind
of product where
human beings sort of would want to form
a cartel
so obviously as the network grows it's
much harder to control 51 because more
and more countries more and more towns
more and more people that you have to
communicate
communicate with um but it's still
something theoretically that could
happen
back to a blockchain what is a
blockchain i just want to remind you
it's a chain of blocks that can cause we
discussed it so much earlier that i
think you have forgotten by now it's a
chain of blocks that contains
information
designed originally to timestamp
documents so that they cannot be changed
so um we're going to go into
how a blockchain visually
you can visualize it in your mind
so each
block in this diagram
contains
the data
the hash the fingerprint of the block
and then the hash of the previous block
so this is how they link together so you
have the data of whatever you've done
whether a transaction whether something
else then it has the hash of that block
and the hash of the previous block and
this is how they all link together and
that's why it's a block chain
um and then um security beyond the hash
we've spoken about this
um we've spoken about the genesis block
we've spoken about the proof of work and
we're spoken about the fact that it's a
distributed network and everybody has a
copy
we've been hearing about decentralized
finance and that's the next thing i
wanted to talk about what is defy
and defy is an umbrella term for
financial services on public blockchains
such as
ethereum
so um
the term decentralized finance or d5
um
it refers to the ecosystem of finance
that is on the
obviously zenith bank and ub and
fidelity
are in front of us they're not the
blockchain
they are in the traditional banking
system
decentralized finance and they are over
sorry and fidelity bank is overseen by
cbn
so it's centralized finance somebody is
looking at everything that they are
doing
cbn have hundreds of supervisors that
they send
to the head office to inspect every
transaction and if they see anything
that is illegal they find them
immediately
in the decentralized finance world there
is no cbm
so this refers to financial services
that you do on the blockchain where the
program itself
and the method of distribution and the
process
is the cbn
and you can do most of the things that
banks support
earn interest borrow
lens
trade derivatives
but it doesn't require the processes the
kyc all of these things that you would
have with the typical bank
and it's usually peer-to-peer
so why is defy important
um i think with crypto with the original
bitcoin bitcoin
was a digital currency and that was a
breakthrough in itself
but what dfi do does is takes the basic
premise of bitcoin
um and expands on it
creating an entire alternative
uh to what we have on ground in nigeria
today
but without the offices and the trading
flaws and the salaries and all of these
things so what people say is that it has
the potential
to create a more open free and fair
financial market
i'm not 100 sure about that this is what
coinbase says and of course cornbread it
conveys crypto exchange what they're
supposed to say but i'm just telling you
the premise but what i want you to go
away with from this lecture is not
wholeheartedly believing that
it's going to create a different
financial system or it's a future of
money or everybody that invests in
bitcoin are going to become billionaires
i don't want you to go away thinking
that what i want you to do is be able to
think logically and critically for
yourself with the information that i've
given you as to what you think
personally
about this new type of finance
so i'm going to talk about nfts
very interesting so um
my like i've been interested in nfts
from you know a sort of intellectual
perspective
um but i think it was a few months ago
somebody called me and was like oh do
you want
a witch mft um nft h i c h like which
like why
or is it which like ajay aj means in
europe nigerian it's a nigerian language
it means like the evil kind of witch
she said it's the evil kind of witch
like ajay that i can become a witch in
the better verse and i can choose what
powers that i want to have that will be
which in this life that i'll be enriched
in the better verse and i buy as soon as
i own the nft which i told you before is
on the blockchain so it's time stamped
that i can really be a witch
and
i said i'm not even interested in being
a rich in this life
or at least i can do some damage to
people that have been horrible to me i
don't have any reason to met address
but why would i want a witch well the
most amazing thing is that she was
charging about nine thousand dollars for
this rich picture
where i can be a witch in another not in
this life oh in another life inside the
better verse
um
and nft prices are pretty crazy um the
the original the ap club
um those eight pictures
i mean people are buying them
for
hundreds of thousands of dollars if not
millions of dollars and i can remember
watching um a video somebody sent it to
me on whatsapp where somebody had one of
those nfts which is essentially just a
picture digital arts and he had it on
his phone and he went into a conference
and there was like a huge crowd around
him like wow you're the owner of one of
these eight nfts
i was so surprised
not a physical ape because you know
there are these gorillas in cross river
there are some animals that we have
there not an ape
a picture of a cartoon ape
but it's nothing to laugh about
because there's money there right now
nfts transform digital works of art and
other collectibles into
one-of-a-kind very verifiable assets
that easily shared trade on the
blockchain
so
like i said it might be
very difficult for people that i have
not been initiated to understand
but honestly people have made serious
money
so jack dawson's first ever tweets on
twitter sold a nft of jackdaws's first
tweet sold for almost three million
dollars
with my brief calculation that's over
one billionaire that's land in banana
island for a picture that was minted
as an nft
of gatoski's first tweets
but you can still go to jack dawson's
first tweet on twitter and screenshot it
and have the picture on your phone but
because it was meeted into an nft and
that is unique and time stamped that was
what brought the value
um so
we'll be looking at
other cryptocurrency assets that can be
bought or sold
so bitcoin is not like an nft you're not
the sole owner you can give it away like
um sorry
they can be replaced or exchanged you
can have an identical one or nfts you
cannot have an identical one
so no two nfts are the same
um so before we go on to cryptocurrency
i want to talk about one more thing
remember we've been on a long journey
and i just don't want to lose anybody so
we've defined bitcoin we know what a
hash is we know what nfts are now
hopefully and i hope i didn't fumble the
explanation at the end of the nft
explanation um like i said i'm not a
computer scientist so i can explain it
from the economics and the finance point
of view um so and we've spoken briefly
about cryptocurrencies we've spoken
about the byzantine um generals problem
we've spoken about the 51
attack and now i'm going to briefly talk
about central bank digital currencies
because this is really important for
nigeria before i go on to crypto so
central bank digital currencies are a
form of digital money
but they are denominated in the national
unit of account so it's the direct
liability of central bank and i was
quite proud last year actually when we
launched one of the world's first global
digital currencies central bank digital
currencies and these can be used by they
can be used wholesale they can be used
retail
so they can be used by businesses they
can be used
in retail institutions as well by
financial institutions and they can be
used in retail um and
and they can either be on the blockchain
or they can use other technologies so
they're not necessarily placed on
blockchain um but i think if i'm not
mistaken the inner is actually based on
the blockchain but not all of the
central bank currencies have to be the
use of
blockchain technology and then this is
our central bank governor and the
president launching
one of the first central bank currencies
in the world
and at the last mpc meeting the central
bank governor said that it had been
downloaded a million times
which is quite small
but
i think it has huge potential
and i'll tell you why
in a place like my state where i'm from
in nigeria kitty state
if they start paying federal government
allocation that you know nigeria is not
the most productive country so it's a
country that generally relies it gets
all revenues they go to the city in the
middle which is abuja and then the money
is shared
so if that's money
the government starts to say look we're
not going to start we're not going to
share it in real money anymore we're
going to share it in inair
that inaira now goes into the states
they now start paying civil servants
in inara
in some states civil servant salaries
are the only real source of money the
only real economy
so if
all civil servants have is in era then
the market woman has to start taking in
air
the people in the supermarket need to
start taking inera
if the most economically powerful block
of people
in most states in nigeria
only are receiving their salaries in
indira then everybody has to start
taking idea
and what happens then
number one
there's lots of people without bank
accounts in nigeria
who aren't financially included who
can't take loans because they don't even
have an account immediately that starts
including the informal sector
into the financial system number two we
know what everybody's earning
so last year in nigeria
the gdp that's all the money in nigeria
all the transactions that go on in
nigeria
so the gdp to tax ratio in nigeria was
six percent
so nigerians pay six percent of all the
money that is made or earned or
exchanged in nigeria
as tax
sounds a lot of money
before you realize that afghanistan
that was a war
that was taliban
paid 9 of their gdp in tax
and in the uk and europe it can be as
high as 35 of gdp as tax so part of the
reason why the government doesn't have
money to do roads and hospitals and all
of the things that they're supposed to
be doing is because actually nigerians
don't pay tax
but can you imagine if it's
but the inaudible source of money that
is coming out of the federal government
is coming out electronically
so it should theoretically
also improve our tax revenues which will
improve all of our lives because the
government will be able to do more stuff
um cash is also very very useful for
corruption
if you want to do a corrupt transaction
then you know what to do on the
blockchain where everybody will see you
what to do is secret
hide the cash
right cash is actually fantastic for
money laundering
inna is possibly the worst thing that
you could use to steal because it can
easily be me
traced to you
so inara also
would help potentially theoretically
reduce corruption
and finally what central bank tries to
do to
control the economy is called monetary
policy
and when there's like really high
inflation and the economy is overheating
they try and like bring that in right um
and they try and stop the banks lending
keep all the banks money in the central
bank
so people have less money they're not
spending it anyhow and the prices of
stuff stops going up and then when
there's a recession they try and like
push money out into the economy and try
and get people spending
um and
that's the way they really control the
economy
that's a lot easier to do right if
everybody is financially included
and the last thing is like i said in my
earlier lectures there are 90 million
poor people in nigeria more poor people
than any country has in the world
now um at the beginning of the covered
pandemic we decided the government
decided that they were going to try and
help all those poor people by giving
them food
my people we know what happened
somewhere in the process of trying to
get the food to the people
the food disappeared or was stolen or
was looted or was kept sure the food
didn't get to the people that it was
meant to get to
so with the e naira you don't need to
give anybody food you can actually just
directly from cbn
transfer to the exact wallet of the poor
people that you want to transfer to
because the problem was while we were
giving out food is because the poor
people don't have bank accounts
and cash would have been worse
if we're giving somebody cash to give to
somebody to give to somebody to give to
somebody the cash would have never
reached in the first place so that's why
they decided to give food because at
least food is harder to steal
but they learned that food is the
hardest to steal but with the ira that
could solve a lot of problems so i've
spoken about some of the problems that
central bank
currencies can um
[Music]
solve in countries like nigeria and in
developing countries across the world
and i'm just going to explain a little
further
um it's uh like i said it's
in the digital it's a digital form of
the national unit of account
so it's not a crypto
one inna is one real naira
um and so it's traditional money but in
digital form
it's issued by the central bank
it's influenced by monetary policy like
i said
and it's based on a digital ledger
and i'll be speaking about ledgers a bit
more um in subsequent
um
in a few more slides where's the digital
ledger which may or may not use um
blockchain
what central bank currency is not it's
not crypto
it's not entirely determined by the
market so the price of bitcoin goes up
it goes down and it's determined by the
market this is not like that
it's one it's it's your naira
um and it's not uh
it's not like a digital electronic cash
so
what you transfer in your app
is electronic cash with a claim against
the bank it's not like that
so central bank digital currencies
according to an economist article i read
and i think even in the bank of
international settlements as well um
over 80 percent of central banks are
thinking about producing some form of
digital currencies nigeria just took the
lead in that area but it's rapidly
evolving um there's several approaches
um to
um how people are thinking about it and
you know some of the things that people
are thinking about are do we just
completely replace notes and coins don't
forget that every cent every commercial
bank in this country has to pay money
when money gets too old they have to pay
money to central bank to destroy it for
them
so it's just an expensive way why can't
we just be spending e-cash but also
people worry about privacy
you know
the boys on the streets of lagos as i'm
sending money to my girlfriend now is it
that central bank who know or how do we
do like people are worried about
anonymity and private privacy like every
transaction no transaction can be secret
and people are just like
is my whole life going to be out there
now like at least if i want to give
somebody cash i can keep the person cash
and as far as if the person is
committing a crime no they just don't
want every transaction that they have to
be recorded
and then things like access and interest
bearing ability are also things that
central banks are thinking about
so
now we've spoken about central bank
digital currencies i'm now going to
speak about what you've all been waiting
for cryptocurrencies um but before i
speak about cryptocurrencies i'll speak
about how they evolved so like i said uh
cryptocurrencies are actually operating
um in the intersection of cryptocurrency
finance and economics and they actually
had some routes in africa
so um two ways that link um the original
cryptocurrency which was bitcoin to
africa
and number one
was the biafra war
now one of the unfortunate things about
nigeria is that we don't teach history
in schools so nobody really knows what
happened
before you know in nigeria but
apparently during the biafra war
um there were you know a group of
ciphers who i'll talk about later who
used cryptography to communicate
um and then there's also a link to kenya
which i'll speak about as well um and
even preceding the cryptocurrency that
worked which is bitcoin there was a
whole graveyard i mentioned ecash there
were some other types even some of the
ideas around paypal that didn't quite
work you know a lot of the people have
tried to make these
virtual currencies
we've been talking about the byzantine
generals problem since 1982
so a lot of the things that saturn um
satoshi nakamoto built on
were some of the failed experiments
reasons why certain things didn't work
over time to get us to this stage
so yeah
cryptocurrency and the buyer for war in
nigeria
so cryptography is actually a way to
communicate with untrusted without
untrust without untrusted parties having
access to that information
and during the civil war
um in nigeria biafrans communicated with
portugal
via cryptography
and the interesting thing right is that
hardly anybody in nigeria even speaks
about this because
nigerians don't know any history but if
you read i was reading like some
norwegian blogs and some um
some british and american cryptography
blogs and they were like still trying to
translate and decode those original
diaphragm messages just as a hobby and
they had actually decoded some of them
and some of them were actually too
difficult for them to
decode
so everybody like there's a whole
movement online that talks about these
biafran ciphers
and how they were able to build these
codes and i think it's a norwegian or
finnish guy that was speaking about how
sophisticated the igbo people must have
been at that time to have that kind of
cryptography ability
to show that some of those codes some of
that cryptography still people are
struggling with it today
and that was how they were communicating
in codes during the war um so that their
untrusted parties would not have access
to the information that they were
passing across
um and i really think that there should
be a nollywood movie made about this
because it's fascinating um
and there has been a hollywood movie
made about a famous
cryptographer
alan turing
who was able to decode some of the
messages that the germans were sending
nazi germany was sending and the movie
is called the imitation game if you want
to watch it and it was about the process
of decoding and sort of hacking into
those
messages and it was part of you know
this art this this
sort of activity um was some
contributed um of course to
saving a lot of lives during the war
empassa in kenya also predated bitcoin
and that was like a major breakthrough
in the
in on the road
to cryptocurrency and electronic actual
digital cash and what i mean by
electronic money is money that you can
send to somebody
without telling anybody else
talu can i send money to you
without any bank knowing about it
electronically
but
what electronic money has done
is you can now send money to somebody
without anybody else being involved
except you and the person that you want
to send money to no central authority
in fact if i want to send some money to
somebody in the uk go look at the swift
it goes to new york
and then goes to england because every
nigerian bank has a correspondent bank
where all forex transactions are sent to
before it goes to the person
so
um cryptocurrency actually
uh eliminates the need for all that but
sorry
i've digressed we're talking about
impersona one person was key to the
breakthrough in electronic money and it
was um definitely predated bitcoin when
safaricom realized that customers were
trading in airtime and created a way
that people could send money through
their mobile phone so this was
definitely a key step in the evolution
leading up to bitcoin and i just wanted
to say it's not as if you know africans
were completely sleeping when all these
things were going on we still had our
own um innovations and own contributions
um to
what eventually became bitcoin um and i
wanted to highlight those and because i
think it's important for young people um
to understand
um the role of african innovation in the
development
of these technologies as well and even
if even if it was one dot that we
contributed i'm just saying that we we
did something
um so
yeah
so the last slide before i actually talk
about bitcoin is to talk about ledgers
because that's what bitcoin is a credit
and debit ledger where every um
transaction or every debit transaction
has a
corresponding credit like a spreadsheet
um and ledgers were actually the
foundation of modern capitalism long
before we developed software and
computers we worked with ledgers and
anybody that's taken ican icon is a
nigerian version of acca we know about
ledgers and double entry bookkeeping and
i've actually put
a picture of one of the most famous
accountants in nigeria on this slide mr
aquintolo williams
you know the audience i can see the
accountants very active and he's like uh
the godfather of accounting he was so
good at accounting that um deloitte was
called delay aquintolla williams i can
tell her williams
when they first came to nigeria because
he was just such a gifted accountant
um and you know
i would be so interested to hear his
views i believe he's still alive i'd be
interested to hear his views um about
um the
the ledger and how the ledger works in
bitcoin
so bitcoin
i see people on instagram what is the
body that i made for bitcoin and this
body that i used to buy my car i'm
trading crypto i'm into crypto how to
get into crypto
i'm not going to say any of that i'm
just going to tell you about bitcoin and
bitcoin was started by satoshi nakamoto
like i said we don't know whether it's a
he she or them
um but what he was aiming to do was
start something that could be classified
as money
basically to me three qualifications it
had to be a unit of account it had to be
a store of value and it had to be a
medium of exchange
and um you know when he first created it
wasn't used that much
as it couldn't be exchanged for any
product
and you know stuff was going on in in
the cyber space it was invented in 2009
i believe and you know in the cyber
space people are saying okay it is a
unit of account because we're using it
we know that okay we have five thousand
we have ten thousand we have one
thousand bitcoins um and it was um a
store of value in that people were
buying bitcoin but it could not be used
to do anything and that was a difficulty
because to make the definition of money
it also has to be used as a medium of
exchange
so this guy lazul las zlo
posted
in may
that he has 10 000 bitcoin
and who was willing to give him two
pizzas
for 10
000 bitcoin
first day nobody answered him
second day he posted the gate that is
money too small all i want is to give
you 10 000 bitcoin
i want to prove that this thing can be
exchanged for something i want to give
anybody 10 000 bitcoin that can deliver
a pizza to my house
and finally somebody answered him and
this is him and his children celebrating
after they had exchanged 10 000 bitcoin
at the time this was 2010
for two pizzas
one bitcoin today
is forty thousand dollars
and he at this time when we were 2010
exchanged 10 000 bitcoins
for two pizzas
two
10 000 bitcoins how much is 10 000
bitcoins worth today
sorry
about four billion naira
i'd have even expected it to be more
than that
because if each one is forty
forty thousand well today it's around
forty two
i think two weeks ago it was even sixty
thousand so it hovers like around fifty
thousand
fifty thousand dollars
so that means it's several billionaire
now
so if you deliver those two pizzas to
his house
at that time
and collected his ten 000
bitcoin
will be a billionaire by now
and actually i told you so people take
bitcoin like a religion
because this was the first time that
bitcoin was actually exchanged for money
on may 22nd people don't go to work on
it one second though people that really
believe in this bitcoin it's a holiday
time for enjoyment trying to celebrate
the first time that this currency was
exchanged for something
and it became
money because it was a unit of account
it was a medium of exchange
and it was a store of value
so we're speaking about mining i'm not
going to go into that game but what i
didn't speak about is the public key and
the private key
so your public key is a key that allows
you to receive any cryptocurrency
transaction
and it's paired with your private key
that's what you use
to
prove that you are the owner
of that bitcoin
so people expose their private keys
public keys but your private key you
have to keep to yourself because if you
give somebody your private key then they
can steal your bitcoin
now how does this all relate to venture
capital because this is a venture
capital course after all
nobody knows who satoshi nara nakamoto
is and a lot of these guys that operate
in the cryptography space obviously you
know that they're cryptography people
cryptography is to hide so they don't
like people knowing their real names so
you as a venture capitalist now how do
you invest in somebody that will not
even turn on their cameronism meeting
let alone come out of their house to
their to your office to meet you they're
called to um pseudonymous founders
people that they yes they founded the
software they founded the script
application but you cannot know them
so how do you go about investing in them
remember i spoke about due diligence in
the forum the lectures
so you have to be able to how do you
diligence or do due diligence on
somebody or something or some entity or
something important you don't even know
so this is the issue that um as as the
crypto space is becoming bigger and
because opportunities are multiplying
these pseudonymous founders are coming
about and venture capital firms are
trying to put in place ways and they can
invest in them
stable coins
stable coins are
coins that derive their price from a
physical thing so it can be stable coins
that derive their price from the value
of the dollar there can be stable coins
that derive their price for the value of
gold there can be so but those are
stable coins that derive their price
from something there's an underlying
asset there it's not just electronic
mean coins are like jokes and the reason
why i put
elon musk here is because
he
is the biggest proponent of a meme coin
called dogecoin which like has a picture
of a dog on it and um yeah every time he
tweets about dogecoin the price goes up
and down depending on how you know the
internet is feeling at the time and he
seems to be able to make a lot of money
from just manipulating what i say
manipulating
uh yeah kind of influencing the market i
guess on some of these like meme coins
um an altcoin is anything that is not
bitcoin
because ethereum is now seen as a
serious coin as well some people call
out coins anything that is not bitcoin
or ethereum
um
i've been experimenting with nigerian
food so we have like typical
starchy food that we eat in our state
which is called pounded jam and it's yam
that's pounded but it's quite heavy and
i'm on a diet i'm maintaining my figure
so i've started
experimenting with cabbage
pounded jam so just pounding the cabbage
up and eating it with the traditional
soup um and carrot pounded jam
and beetroot pounder jam just vegetable
pounder jams basically with no pounder
jam in it um so some people on social
media have been saying that i'm eating
alt swallows
because it's not the original one it's
not bitcoin it's another one
so they must be out
and the real one is about to jam um and
you know that's what altcoins are seen
like the real coin
is seen as bitcoin and anything else is
seen as an altcoin um but some people
obviously
say that
our ethereum has kind of established
itself also and anything that is not
bitcoin or not ethereum is now seen as
an altcoin and there are over 900 um
outgoing currencies that have been
created since bitcoin
so i've spoken a lot about bitcoin and
i've told you some people see it as a
religion some people say that bitcoin is
going to save the world some people you
know people are saying it will create a
fairer financial system some people say
power you know bitcoin is giving power
to the people some people will say that
bitcoin is the one that is going to lift
people out of poverty you see some
people talking about bitcoin conferences
like pastors talking churches where
they're dancing up and down they're
saying you better believe in this thing
it's going to save your life i'm not one
of those people
um i'm not a bitcoin maximalist and i'm
not a bitcoin
minimalist i'm somebody that believes
that it could be very exciting um but
you'd not see me like preaching out of
the gospel of bitcoin on a sunday
morning
bitcoin does have some problems
number one it's slow
so visa is able to tran um to do
hundreds of transactions
per second
um most cryptocurrencies can only really
do
under 30 transactions per second so it's
slow
it's inoperable meaning most of the
financial technology into innovations
that we've had still plug into the
original system so they can operate with
the original system so we've had waves
of financial technology and the latest
in nigeria has been the payment
companies like paystack which was one of
our first investments at the first vc
fund um that
i co-founded with mr augusto and abbas
and mr dave um called greentree
investments and this was you know one of
the first very large payment companies
that was eventually bought by stripe
and
pay stack could still you could still
use your own
zenith or uba or fidelity bank or stand
big bank bank accounts to transfer money
into pay stack
right you could that those technologies
could connect together
whereas
blockchain is a completely different
system
there's also the issue of scalability
can it scale to serve the needs of
everybody can this technology really and
i'm sorry just on the point of inter in
opera inoperability even between
blockchains in between different
blockchains
very very difficult to make them work
together
um and then in terms of scalability
you need it to really scale to serve the
needs of everybody in the world
basically if this is going to be the new
money
and can the technology do that right now
and then cyber security
there's
nothing that replaces the feeling
for me personally
of being able to go into my bank and
change it for the bank manager like you
can get angry back you can go there but
this one there's no bank if you're
hacked and your money is missing
then there's nobody that you can't get
angry with there's no customer service
and
madame sit down we'll solve your problem
that is it the money is lost it's been
hacked
so what do you do about this situation
when there's no manager there's no md
there's no branch manager customer
service there's no customer you cannot
call anybody
so if there's cyber security issues
those need to be looked at as well and a
lot of people complain about this um
cyber security issues but i i think that
people
like to be able to go into a branch and
ask questions
my money is missing what are you people
going to do about the uba
yes i want to see the md i want to see
the gm i want to see the agent you can't
do that in bitcoin there's nothing like
that
you've not you if you've lost your body
your body is lost if you were hacked or
you misplaced your public um private key
that is it
there's no recourse even some people
keep their bitcoin in hard storage so
they keep it on a usb if you lose a
uh usb the money is lost there's nothing
that can be done about it there's no
centralized person keeping any record of
it
so these are some of the things that
build a bit of a case against
crypto
um stephen
deal is very critical of crypto and i'll
read what he said out word for word
because i think it's really interesting
he said the crypto project has had 13
years
to try and find a problem to solve and
it has not found one
the real world has fundamental
constraints that make the technology
unworkable
whenever it has to interact
with the outside world the benefits of
decentralization disappear
and the solutions end up simply
recreating slower and worse versions of
the processes and structures that
already exist
despite that
for 13 years
these projects have done nothing but
scam people
by creating synthetic asset bubbles for
gambling
and destroying the environment
there are fundamental limitations to the
scalability
of blockchain
based technologies
and every use case is better served by
simpler technology
except for crime
ransomware
extra legal or illegal gambling
and evading sanctions
all of which
i drain on a society not a benefit
taken as a whole
the technology has no tangible benefits
over simply using trusted parties
your zenith your uba your central bank
and centralized databases
so i
decided to start my close with this
quote because i feel like we started on
a very enthusiastic note
and
even the
title of the module is called the future
of money
and we've discussed around a number of
issues which are all really nicely
brought together in this one quote
um and the next slide further goes on
with the challenges
because
what bitcoin claims is it's the money of
the free
all people that are living in poverty
all people that can't have bank accounts
all people that perhaps have been
excluded from the financial system
all people that have been told that
they're too poor to open bank accounts
can now be part of a new financial
system i sound like one of the victims
of bitcoin russian racks of lists now
why people are free
oh wow
yes and no
you see
one of the things that people complain
about the traditional banking system is
a level of inequality
and the fact that this current system
just makes the rich get richer and the
poor get poorer
and the bitcoin maximalist will say you
know
we're different
why are they
the top two percent
of accounts
earn 95
of the 800 billion dollar supply of
bitcoin
0.1
of miners are responsible for half
of all the mining output
in fact professor galloway at nyu stern
says if bitcoin was a country
it would be the most unequal country in
the world
anyway if you still want to invest in
grip um in bitcoin
i will show you how it fits into
some traditional portfolio models
now if you really want a detailed
lecture on portfolio management value at
risk um malkowip's portfolio um
markowitz portfolio theory then go right
onto my banking and capital market video
which is also on youtube um it's about
two hours and it will take you through
all of that stuff um in a better way
than i can here but what i will talk
about is a capital asset pricing model
quickly which is one of the most famous
and respected models in finance and
probably the benchmark
theory for expected returns in a
portfolio
and
simply stated it says that investors
should hold risky securities according
to the market weighted values
um and the capm would say that you
shouldn't hold cryptocurrency because it
has
um it doesn't it's not an equity right
um so capm says that you shouldn't hold
large amounts of currency and cash
because they're not good for an
efficient portfolio and hopefully none
of you are holding large amounts of cash
um
because yeah that's generally true and
because the capm will classify
crypto as cash
um because it doesn't have intrinsic
value and it doesn't pay dividends
um capm will probably say
that it should not be part of an optimal
portfolio but this is not the only lens
to look at this is a capm lens look at
it if you look at the sharp ratio for
instance and this was work done um by
jessica watcher
and she's a professor of finance at
water university in america who
specializes
in cryptocurrency and digital currency
and she talks about the sharpe ratio
let's okay capm doesn't work let's look
at the sharp ratio
and the sharp ratio measures the
performance of an investment such as a
security or a portfolio compared to the
risk-free asset adjusting for the risk
and the risk-free asset in nigeria would
be
silence
federal government treasury bills right
that would be like a risk-free asset so
what you're doing is trying to see okay
what would this give me compared to um
for federal government treasury bills
um and for bitcoin and ripple
um the sharp ratios or the risk ratios
um compared to the risk-free rate um are
about the same as investing on the s p
500. in terms of risk so buying ordinary
shares on the
american stock exchange ether is
slightly higher risk but not
overwhelmingly so
however
if you go into the theory around
calculating sharp ratios
you'd find out that
probably a lot of the wins
in crypto
it would attribute to survivor bias
you just really got lucky
um and trading costs so this
if you are looking at it from a sharp
ratio perspective
um it would most likely probably argue
against investing in cryptocurrency as
an asset class
but
if you're in search of alpha
an alpha of a portfolio is the excess
return it produces compared to the
benchmark index
um which capm doesn't explain
then cryptocurrencies do hold the
potential to generate supernumeral and
normal returns
and if you're looking for alpha and
you're using the alpha lens to look at
these investments
and you're looking for these super
normal returns at high levels of risk
then yes
the alpha lens would suggest that
they're a good investment
wow this has been quite a journey
we've looked at
blockchain and defined some of the terms
associated with it we've spoken about
central bank digital currencies and nfts
and we've spoken about cryptocurrencies
we've spoken about decentralized finance
and we've spoken about how you should
view these whether you want to call them
assets or currencies um according to
your your
portfolio
um thank you very much for listening
